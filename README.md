👋 Hi, I’m @coo-cure51, the Chief Operating Officer of CURE51, the first worldwide database of Cancer Outliers. Our mission is to unlock new treatments for deadly cancers by leveraging the resilience and survival mechanisms of outliers.

👀 I’m interested in harnessing the power of data, technology, and scientific research to transform cancer treatment. We focus on the most challenging cancers like Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Stage IV, Glioblastoma (GBM), and Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Stage IV.

🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest advancements in multi-omics data analysis, machine learning in healthcare, and innovative cancer research methodologies to identify potential cures for the most lethal forms of cancer.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that utilize data science, bioinformatics, and computational biology to explore new frontiers in cancer treatment. We are open to partnerships with research institutions, technology companies, and individuals passionate about making a difference in the fight against cancer.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me at elmehdi@cure51.com or connect with me here on GitHub. We are always looking for collaborators, supporters, and anyone interested in joining our mission.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Beyond my work with CURE51, I'm fascinated by the history of science and the stories of unsung heroes like Rosalind Franklin, whose work has inspired our mission. I'm also an avid supporter of initiatives that bring technology and healthcare closer to improve patient outcomes worldwide.
